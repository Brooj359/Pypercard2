                                Your life is <em><b>sad</b></em>, very <em><b>sad</b></em>. Up until now you haven't had much of a chance 
                                to fix it. Once when you were a kid you dreamed of becoming a knight, saving people, but now you have become 
                                depressed and are going through a mid-life crisis. But thankfully, fate has bestowed you with another opprutunity 
                                to change your life, the opprutunity to go on an <em><b>Adventure!</b></em>

                                You died that night of alcohol poisoning. No one found your body either because no one comes to visit you, <em><b>ever</b></em>.

                            you can hear coyotes howling, and on the left you can hear a bear. With the weapons you have currently, you have a decent chance of 
                            winning a fight against the bear, but you could have a garunteed chance of winning against the nearby coyotes if there is a small number
                            of them. Problem is, you have no idea how many there are. <em><b>Which path shall you choose?</b></em>

                            <p>I was just joking, bad news. The trail merges ahead and now you must face both the lion and the coyotes. Judging from the looks of it,
                                this might be the biggest brown bear, <em>ever</em>, and the biggest pack of coyotes, <em>ever</em>. Thankfully they are fighting each other...
                                Nope, they spotted you and are now ganging up on you. This is quite unfortunate. <em>Fortunatley</em>, you brought plenty of weapons!
                                You brought a bow, broadsword, nunchucks, and a bomb. If you choose the bomb, you could also suffer major damage. Which do you choose?
