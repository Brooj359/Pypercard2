                            of them. Problem is, you have no idea how many there are. <em><b>Which path shall you choose?</b></em>

                                <p>But not before the witch teleports in fronts of you and knocks you over. She gets on top of you and puts you in an arm lock, breaking your
                                    arm, then flipping you over for a leg lock, breaking your leg. Finally, she suplexes you and gets you in a chokehold.
                                    As she chokes you out, you can see her gold wrestling medals being displayed on a shelf. You can hear the witch cackle
                                    as your vision blurs, and turns to black<em>You died!</em>
