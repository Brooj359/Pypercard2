                            you can hear coyotes howling, and on the left you can hear a bear. With the weapons you have currently, you have a decent chance of

                                this might be the biggest brown bear, <em>ever</em>, and the biggest pack of coyotes, <em>ever</em>. Thankfully they are fighting each other...
                                Nope, they spotted you and are now ganging up on you. This is quite unfortunate. <em>Fortunatley</em>, you brought plenty of weapons!
                                You brought a bow, broadsword, nunchucks, and a bomb. If you choose the bomb, you could also suffer major damage. Which do you choose?

                                    As she chokes you out, you can see her gold wrestling medals being displayed on a shelf. You can hear the witch cackle
                                    as your vision blurs, and turns to black<em>You died!</em>

                                    yourself with 3 paths to choose from, left, right, and forward. From the left you hear a noise, as if an animal is making it. To the right you

                                    what it could be. A big dragon? Maybe someone else is using bombs... You finally reach the light, burnt out and exhausted. You look up to see what is making the stomping,
                                    and it's a giant! You think of turning back, but behind him you see many riches, probably enough for a whole kingdom to share. Gold, diamonds, swords, and anything else valuable you could name
                                    Normally you'd run, but it seems the treasure behind the giant has intrigued you. How will you get the treasure?

                                    You start to traverse around the perimeter of the giant's cave, being fast but careful you make no noise. When you are about halfway to the treasure,
                                    the giant moves to his left and crawls through a doorway of a sort. Trying not to waste time, you make a dash towards the treasure. When you make it, 
                                    you let out a sigh of relief and begin browse through the collection of treasures. You see rings, swords, fancy daggers, bracelets, earrings, and more,
                                    but none of them really catch your eye, until you stumble upon a gold chain. The chains are thick and sturdy, and allow for your bling to be pushed to
                                    the maximum. You try it on, but as you do, let out a "Yipee!". It echoes in the room, but you're too excited to care. You keep digging through the pile of
                                    treasure, and you begin to wonder what happened to giant. Simultaneously, you feel a draft of wind blow down on you, except you remember there is no openings
                                    in the roof. That's when you make the realization, and mutter your final words, "He's behind me, isn't he?" as the giant squishes you with his big toe.

                                    where on earth you are. You tried re-tracing your steps but in the end it did nothing but make you more lost. You have now ended your journey, lost,
                                    scared, and afraid. <em>You win?</em>

                                    too much and just try to enjoy yourself. Just as you finally do, the trail ends a the base of a big mountain with an entrance at the end of the path.
                                    You begin to appraoch the entrance when you start to feel vibrations in your feet. They seem to be coming from in the mountain... I guess

                                    After a couple minutes, you stop at noises around you. You start to listen closely and hear 2 things. To your left, the voice of a little girl, and 
                                    to the right you hear something moving. You decide you should investigate one of the noises. Which noise will you investigate?

                                    over a pile of leaves. You pause, but she reassures you she was just trying to have some fun, so you keep following her. As you walk over the pile of 
                                    leaves they collapse and leave you at the bottom of a 20 feet deep hole. You look up and see the little girl smiling, then waving, then leaving. You

                                    You wake up, forgetting what just happened. You try to get up, but your body won't let you. You look around with your head and see the wolf 
                                    sitting next to you with your sword in it's mouth. It sees you woke up and approaches you. It licks your face and sits next to you. You
                                    try to get up again and successfully sit up. You pet it and it helps you get up. You grab your sword and backpack and try walking away but the 
                                    wolf follows you. Looks like you've made a friend! You pet him again, but this time your stomach starts to growl and you realize how hungry you 
                                    are. You're out of food too. Where on earth are you gonna get any food? Unless... <em>You Win?</em>
